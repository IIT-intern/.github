## Deakin-IIT Kharagpur Foreign Internship Projects

_Projects in T1 2024_

**Project-1: Time Series Anomaly Detection**

Time series anomaly detection is the task of identifying unusual patterns or events in temporal data that do not conform to normal behavior. It has many applications in various domains, such as finance, health care, security, and manufacturing. However, it also poses many challenges, such as high dimensionality, noise, seasonality, and non-stationarity of the data. This project focuses on developing novel and effective methods for time series anomaly detection using statistical models and deep learning methods. The required skills include Python programming, basic machine learning and statistics background.


**Project-2: Mining Massive Trajectory Data**

Trajectory data is the record of the spatial and temporal movements of objects, such as vehicles, animals, or humans. Mining massive trajectory data can reveal valuable insights into the behavior, preferences, and patterns of the objects and their environment. It can also enable various applications, such as traffic management, urban planning, wildlife conservation, and location-based services. We are looking for master students who are interested in developing novel and effective methods for mining massive trajectory data. The students will work on topics such as clustering, classification, outlier detection, pattern mining, and visualization of trajectory data. The required skills include Python programming, basic machine learning and statistics background.


**Project-3: Anomaly detection for industrial quality assurance** 

In modern manufacturing, quality assurance plays a crucial role in ensuring product integrity and customer satisfaction. Traditional quality control methods, often relying on manual inspection, are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Anomaly detection, a data-driven approach, offers a promising solution to automate and enhance quality assurance processes. This research aims to explore techniques to implement anomaly detection in real-time, enabling immediate identification and correction of defects. The required skills include Python programming, basic machine learning and statistics background.


**Project-4: Data Stream Clustering for Real-Time Data Analysis**

Data stream clustering is the task of grouping similar data points from a continuous and unbounded stream of data. It can enable real-time data analysis for various domains, such as sensor networks, social media, e-commerce, and cyber security. However, it also poses many challenges, such as limited memory, evolving data distribution, concept drift, and outlier detection. We are looking for master students who are interested in developing novel and effective methods for data stream clustering. The students will work on topics such as online learning, incremental clustering, adaptive clustering, and stream summarization. The required skills include Python programming, basic machine learning and statistics background.
